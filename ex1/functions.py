'''
In this module you will define several functions.

Please document your functions according to
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt
'''

# Example so that you can see a passing test


def f():
    """Returns the string 'success'
    """
    return "success"

# Define a function named add that takes two numbers and returns the sum.

# Define a function named to_tuple that takes three arguments and returns a
# tuple of these three arguments.

# Define a function named check5 that checks if a number is greater than 5 and
# returns True or False.

# Define a function named check_n that check is a number is greater than n. The
# number should be the first argument and n the second

# Define a function named check_list that takes two arguments. The first
# argument is a list of numbers and the second argument is the number n to
# compare against. The function should return a list with equal length as the
# input list containing for each number in the original list either True or
# False if the number was greater than or equal to n.

# Define a function named check_list_nth that does the same as check_list but
# uses every nth element of the input list. You will need a third input
# argument.
